steps for encode/decoding files:
1. compile the program with compiler of choice
2. to encode run ".\AudioEncoder.exe encode (source file) (destination file)"
     note: destination file always has to be a .wav as of now
3. to decode run ".\AudioEncoder.exe decode (source file) (destination file)"
     note: source file will always be .wav and the destination file type must be same as the original, name can be anything
4. enjoy :)

files are not encrypted as of now
